# Web-Page-Design-2
A web page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Hello readers,

This is a website which I built only for practice purposes in order to get good hold of some animation features, form and some basic javasript. Did not put a lot of effort into selecting fonts as that was not my main concern here. For that check another "Web Page Design" repo which I made.

Thanks for reading, have fun!!!
